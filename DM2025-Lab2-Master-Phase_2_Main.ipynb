      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "To understand how neural networks work, let's use the brain analogy:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Neurons:** In the brain, neurons are the basic building blocks that receive, process, and transmit information. In a neural network, these are represented by **artificial neurons** or **nodes**.\n",
       "*   **Synapses:** Neurons in the brain are connected by synapses, which transmit signals. In a neural network, these connections are represented by **weights**. These weights determine the strength and influence of one neuron's output on another.\n",
       "*   **Learning:** The brain learns by strengthening or weakening synaptic connections based on experience. Neural networks learn by adjusting their weights through a process called **training**.\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Structure of a Neural Network**\n",
       "\n",
       "A typical neural network is organized into layers:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Input Layer:** This layer receives the raw data. Each node in the input layer represents a feature of the data. For example, if you're analyzing images of handwritten digits, the input layer might have nodes representing each pixel's intensity.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Hidden Layers:** These layers are where the \"magic\" happens. There can be one or many hidden layers. Each node in a hidden layer receives input from the previous layer, performs a calculation, and passes its output to the next layer. The complexity of the problem often dictates the number of hidden layers and nodes within them.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Output Layer:** This layer produces the final result of the neural network. The number of nodes in the output layer depends on the task. For example, if you're classifying images into 10 categories (digits 0-9), the output layer would have 10 nodes, each representing the probability of the input belonging to that category.\n",

       "*   **Input:** Data is fed into the input layer.\n",
       "*   **Weighted Sum:** Each node in the first hidden layer receives inputs from the input layer. Each input is multiplied by its corresponding weight. These weighted inputs are then summed up.\n",
       "*   **Activation Function:** A mathematical function, called an **activation function**, is applied to the weighted sum. This function introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh. The output of the activation function is then passed to the next layer.\n",
       "*   **Repeat:** This process of weighted summation and activation is repeated for each subsequent hidden layer until the output layer is reached.\n",
       "*   **Prediction:** The output layer produces a prediction based on the processed information.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Backpropagation (The Learning Phase):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Error Calculation:** The network's prediction is compared to the actual correct answer (the \"ground truth\"). The difference between the prediction and the ground truth is the **error**.\n",
       "*   **Gradient Descent:** The goal of backpropagation is to minimize this error. It uses an optimization algorithm called **gradient descent**. Imagine a landscape where the error is the altitude. Gradient descent is like a ball rolling down the steepest slope to find the lowest point (minimum error).\n",
       "*   **Weight Adjustment:** Backpropagation calculates how much each weight contributed to the error. It then adjusts the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient (the direction of steepest increase in error) to reduce the error. This adjustment is done iteratively.\n",
       "*   **Iteration:** This entire process of forward propagation and backpropagation is repeated many times (epochs) with different batches of data. With each iteration, the network's weights are fine-tuned, and its predictions become more accurate.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Components and Concepts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Weights:** The numerical values that determine the strength of connections between neurons. These are the primary parameters that a neural network learns.\n",
       "*   **Biases:** Similar to weights, biases are additional parameters that allow the activation function to be shifted, further enhancing the network's ability to learn.\n",
       "*   **Activation Function:** Introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to model complex relationships.\n",
       "*   **Loss Function (or Cost Function):** Measures the error between the predicted output and the actual output.\n",
       "*   **Optimizer:** An algorithm (like gradient descent) that adjusts the weights to minimize the loss function.\n",

Through a process of forward propagation (making predictions) and backpropagation (adjusting weights to reduce errors), they iteratively improve their ability to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Their ability to learn complex, non-linear relationships makes them a cornerstone of modern AI."

       "\n",
       "A neural network is made up of interconnected layers of \"neurons.\" Let's look at the building blocks.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 1. The Neuron (or Node)\n",
       "\n",
       "Think of a single neuron as a tiny decision-maker. It receives information, processes it, and then passes its output along.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "A neuron takes several **inputs**, each with a **weight** attached.\n",
       "*   **Inputs:** These are pieces of data. For an image, an input might be the brightness of a single pixel.\n",
       "*   **Weights:** This is the most important concept! A weight represents the *strength* or *importance* of an input. A high weight means the neuron pays a lot of attention to that input; a low weight means it mostly ignores it. **Learning is the process of adjusting these weights.**\n",
       "\n",
       "The neuron adds up all the weighted inputs. If this sum is above a certain threshold (determined by an **activation function**), the neuron \"fires\" and sends a signal to the next neurons.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2. The Layers\n",
       "\n",
       "Individual neurons are organized into layers. A typical network has three types of layers:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Input Layer:** This is the network's \"senses.\" It receives the initial data. For a cat picture, each neuron in the input layer might represent one pixel of the image.\n",
       "*   **Hidden Layers:** These are the layers between the input and output. This is where the real \"thinking\" happens. A simple network might have one hidden layer, while a \"deep\" neural network (from \"deep learning\") has many. Each layer learns to recognize progressively more complex patterns.\n",
       "    *   *Layer 1* might learn to detect simple edges and colors.\n",
       "    *   *Layer 2* might combine those edges to recognize shapes like ears or eyes.\n",
       "    *   *Layer 3* might combine those shapes to recognize a cat's face.\n",
       "*   **Output Layer:** This layer gives the final result. For a \"cat or not cat\" problem, the output layer might have one neuron that outputs a value between 0 (not a cat) and 1 (definitely a cat).\n",
       "\n",

       "### The Learning Process (Training)\n",
       "\n",
       "So how does the network learn the right **weights**? This is the magic of training.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 1: Forward Propagation (Making a Guess)**\n",

       "*   *Initial Guess:* The first time, all the weights are random, so the network's guess is complete nonsense. It might see a cat and predict \"0.3\" (meaning 30% chance it's a cat).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 2: Calculate the Error (The Loss Function)**\n",
       "You compare the network's prediction (0.3) to the correct label (1, for cat). The difference between them is the **error** (or \"loss\"). In this case, the error is high.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3: Backpropagation (Learning from the Mistake)**\n",
       "This is the crucial step. The network sends the error signal *backward* from the output layer through the hidden layers. As it travels back, it figures out which neurons and weights were most responsible for the error.\n",
       "*   *Analogy:* Imagine a team project that gets a bad grade. The team leader (backpropagation) goes back to each member and figures out who contributed most to the mistakes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 4: Update the Weights (Gradient Descent)**\n",
       "The network uses the information from backpropagation to make tiny adjustments to all the weights. Weights that contributed to the error are changed so they are less likely to make the same mistake again.\n",
       "*   *Analogy:* Think of this as slightly turning thousands of tiny knobs. Each turn is designed to make the final output a little closer to the correct answer next time.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 5: Repeat, Repeat, Repeat**\n",
       "You repeat this process (Forward Propagation -> Calculate Error -> Backpropagation -> Update Weights) with thousands or millions of examples from your dataset. Each time, the weights are adjusted slightly, and the network gets progressively better at its task. Over time, it becomes incredibly accurate at recognizing patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "### What Can Neural Networks Do?\n",
       "\n",
       "Because they are so good at finding patterns in complex data, they are used everywhere:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Image Recognition:** Identifying objects in photos and videos (e.g., tagging friends on social media, self-driving cars identifying pedestrians).\n",
       "*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and generating human language (e.g., Google Translate, chatbots, and AI assistants like me!).\n",
       "*   **Recommendation Engines:** Predicting what you might want to buy or watch next (e.g., Netflix, Amazon, Spotify).\n",
       "*   **Medical Diagnosis:** Analyzing medical images (like X-rays or MRIs) to detect diseases.\n",
       "*   **Financial Forecasting:** Predicting stock market movements or detecting fraudulent transactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, a neural network is a powerful pattern-recognition machine that learns from examples, much like a human brain. It works by passing data through layers of interconnected neurons and continuously adjusting the connections (weights) between them to improve its accuracy."

However, it's crucial to understand that they are a **mathematical abstraction** and not a direct biological simulation. The analogy serves as a conceptual guide, but the implementation is purely computational.\n",

       "The basic unit of a neural network is the **artificial neuron**, often referred to as a **perceptron**. A single perceptron performs a simple computation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Weighted Summation:** It receives multiple input signals ($x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$). Each input signal is multiplied by a corresponding **weight** ($w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$). These weights represent the strength of the connection between neurons.\n",
       "2.  **Bias Term:** A **bias term** ($b$) is added to the weighted sum. The bias can be thought of as an intercept term in a linear equation, allowing the neuron to activate even when all inputs are zero, or shifting the activation threshold.\n",
       "3.  **Activation Function:** The result of the weighted sum plus the bias ($z = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b$) is then passed through a non-linear **activation function** ($f$). This non-linearity is critical for the network's ability to learn complex patterns. Without it, a multi-layered network would simply collapse into a single linear transformation, equivalent to a single perceptron.\n",

The flow of information is generally unidirectional, from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. This is known as a **feedforward neural network**. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants (LSTMs, GRUs) introduce feedback loops, allowing them to process sequential data.\n",

       "\n",
       "3.  **Backpropagation:** This is the core algorithm for training neural networks. It computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network. This is achieved by applying the **chain rule of calculus** to propagate the error backward from the output layer to the input layer. The gradient indicates the direction and magnitude of change needed for each parameter to reduce the loss.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Parameter Update:** The weights and biases are updated in the direction opposite to the gradient, scaled by a **learning rate** ($\\alpha$). This is the essence of gradient descent:\n",

       "*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, and regularization parameters are all **hyperparameters** that need to be set before training. Finding optimal hyperparameters often involves experimentation and techniques like grid search or random search.\n",
       "*   **Computational Resources:** Training deep neural networks, especially on large datasets, requires significant computational power, often leveraging GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for parallel processing.\n",

       "In summary, neural networks are powerful computational models that learn by adjusting the strengths of connections (weights) between artificial neurons. They process information through layers of interconnected nodes, employing non-linear activation functions to capture complex relationships. The learning process, driven by backpropagation and gradient descent, iteratively refines these weights to minimize prediction errors, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks from classification and regression to natural language processing and computer vision."

For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we define this schema using Python classes. Think of each class as defining a JSON object:\n",
    "*   The **attributes** of the class (e.g., `topic_name`, `sub_title`) become the keys in the final JSON object.\n",
    "*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even nest these classes inside one another to create complex, hierarchical JSON structures. This allows us to precisely control the format of the output, transforming the LLM from a simple text generator into a reliable tool for automated and structured data extraction.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at.

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">For the exercise in this section there is no need to re-run the cells, you can use the data that has been saved previously to the corresponding directory.</span>\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
